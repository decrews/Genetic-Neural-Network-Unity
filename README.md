# Genetic Neural Network in Unity

The project includes a Unity3D project to demonstrate the neural network.  In addition to the neural network class, an agenet manager is used to evolve the networks over time.  The bots attempt to solve a simple 2D platformer that contains platforms and enemies.  

The input of the network is the platform and enemy positions.  The output are left and right movement and jumping.
